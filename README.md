# Map STRING PPIs

This repository is to extract directed PPIs from STRING-DB and process the data into a readable format.

## About

This is useful as it helps identify high-quality PPIs and fursther explore the biological network space towards elucidating synergistic behaviour of combinations.

## Team
So far my team is small - just 1 person, but I'm willing to work with you!

## Setup & Requirements
This project requires a raw PPI file from STRING-DB (http://string-db.org/).
